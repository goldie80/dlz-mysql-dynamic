Description: DLZ dlopen() MySQL Driver for Bind 9
 This is an attempt to port the original Bind 9 DLZ dlz_mysql_driver.c as
 found in the Bind 9 source tree into the new DLZ dlopen driver
 API. The goals of this project are as follows:
 .
 - Provide DLZ facilities to OEM-supported Bind distributions
 - Support both v1 (Bind 9.8) and v2 (Bind 9.9) of the dlopen() DLZ
   API
